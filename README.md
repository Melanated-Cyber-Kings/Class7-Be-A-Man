## 📖 Operation Directives: The Workflow (Don't Deviate)

Follow these rules or end up flatlined. Simple as that.

<details open>
<summary>🟢 Directive 01: Initializing Local Port (The Basics)</summary>

Know your turf. Clone the main grid to your local rig.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Melanated-Cyber-Kings/Class7-Be-A-Man.git
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>🔵 Directive 02: Syncing Remote Data-Stream (Avoid Headaches)</summary>

Sync with the collective before you push. Save yourself the merge conflict hell.
```bash
# First, jack into your designated sub-net
git checkout your-branch-name

# Then, pull the latest data-stream.
git pull origin your-branch-name
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>🟡 Directive 03: Data-Vault Structuring (Pretend You're Organized)</summary>

Keep your gear straight. Don't make a bigger mess.
📂 Use weekly folders: `Week_01_Drop`, `Week_02_Drop`, etc.
📌 Don't mix your drops.
</details>

<details>
<summary>🟣 Directive 04: Forging Your Personal Sub-Net (Your Own Corner of Chaos)</summary>

Keep your chaos contained in a personal branch.
```bash
git checkout -b Your-Name-Be-A-Man-Branch
```
✅ **Protocol:** Stay in your own branch. Don't infect the main.
</details>

<details>
<summary>📝 Directive 05: Log Your Traces (Prove You Did Something)</summary>

If it's not logged, it didn't happen.
📝 Each weekly drop needs a `README.md`. Make it clear enough for a corpo to follow.
</details>

<details>
<summary>📤 Directive 06: Final Data-Drop & Upload (The Moment of Truth)</summary>

Time to deliver. Don't choke.
1.  Put data in the right vault.
2.  Prep the payload: `git add .`
3.  Seal the deal: `git commit -m "feat: Week X Drop | [Your Handle]"`
4.  Upload: `git push origin Your-Name-Be-A-Man-Branch`
🎯 Keep it clean. THEO's watching.
